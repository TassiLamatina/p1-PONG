# p1-PONG

Since my JS skills are still quite minimal, I decided to re-create the game that launched video games to consumers, PONG. I figured if it could be created in the early 70s the chance of me excelling it are much greater than something with higher graphics and more JS manipulation.

I plan on being able to use mostly HTML, CSS and JS for this. Definitely looking forward to the process as my JS skills are quite minimal and poor at this stage.

MVP: Wire frames seem pretty simple for this game. one page interactive game. simple border, game score at top of page for each player. two moving paddles that are controlled by your keyboard, and a fuctional scoreboard.

goal is to be able to get the paddles fully fuctional controlled by up and down arrows on keyboard. computer will be controlled by w= up s= down.

a strech goal would be to be able to incorporate a fully functional music option 

most of my roadblocks are going to come from actual JS coding which is super intimidating to me.
